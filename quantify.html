							<h2>Inspiration</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>There are many small businesses in Atlanta because Atlanta is a entrepreneurship hub. Many people pursue entrepreneurship to expand their network and retain profits. A common problem for businesses is keeping up to date with the current health of their company. Many small businesses in particular, donâ€™t have systems put in place to measure their overall success.</p>

								<h2>What it does</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Quantify depicts the overall health of the business with key metrics such as: costs of goods sold, operating expenses, current assets, long-term liabilities, total debt, cash flow, etc. We decided to create a web app that gives businesses a grade of how well their business is performing. We based the grades upon different inputs that the owner provides and weighed them based on importance. The user can submit their data and the site provides metric analysis based on the input data. This analysis page gives them a breakdown of their grade to understand where and how to grow.</p>

							<h2>How we built it</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>We built the web application utilizing back end and frontend development. We built the web application utilizing Python, PHP, and HTML/CSS. We also used Adobe Photoshop to customize the layout and design of the web application, adding text boxes, a logo, and a background.</p>

							<h2>Challenges</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Some challenges we ran into were pulling real data needed for the application because the data we could find was limited. In addition, we can find data on what companies are doing for their performance and overall sales, however it is difficult to find industry-specific values and metrics that tell the whole story. If we had more time, we would be able to get more information.</p>
