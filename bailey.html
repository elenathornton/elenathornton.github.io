								<p><strong>Bailey</strong> - Pocket Pit<em> </em> | The day we got her, my parents called me downstairs and I came down to see the cutest puppy running around the living room. I had been under the impression that we weren't getting a new dog anytime soon, since my sister and I had been begging for months to no avail. <br/>"Whose dog is that?" I asked.<br/>"She's ours," replied my sister.<br/>I didn't really believe her but I ran up to meet the dog and she tackled me with kisses.<br/>"No really, is she ours?"<br/>"We're petsitting for some friends," responded my dad in a joking manner. I wasn't ready to let my guard down because I had already fallen in love with her.<br/>"What's her name?"<br/>"Bailey."<br/><br/>My parents had adopted her from <a href="http://refugerescue.org">Refuge Rescue</a>, a dog rescue organization based in Woodstock. She was only five months old when we got her in December of 2016 but still as headstrong and clumsy as she is today.</p>
								<p>Fast forward to today and she is spoiled <em>rotten</em>. She absolutely adores car rides and long walks, as most dogs do, and she needs to be the center of attention. She's super friendly and will give anyone and everyone kisses. </p>
