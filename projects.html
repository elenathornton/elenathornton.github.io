							<p><strong><a href="https://elenathornton.github.io/ph" target="_blank">PantherHackers</a></strong> - <em>Website Concept</em><br />Recently, I've taken it upon myself to create a concept website for PantherHackers, one of the computer science organizations at Georgia State. My goals include providing a resource for students to connect with and explore PantherHackers and everything we offer, including the annual hackathon, the individual interest groups, and resources for learning to code.</p>

							<p><strong>Unnamed Project</strong> - <em>Personal Project</em><br />My dad has complained to me about how our new garage door opener is advanced enough to have an app that lets us see the status of our garage doors and even open or close them remotely but does nothing to help us keep from leaving it open overnight. In an effort to fix this, I plan on using a Raspberry Pi computer and a magnetic switch for the door to check the status of the door at night and send everyone in the house a notification if it needs to be closed. </p>

							<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/elenathornton/Quantify" target="_blank">Quantify</a></strong> - <em>Hackathon Winner</em><br /><small>April 2019</small><br />There are many small businesses in Atlanta because Atlanta is a entrepreneurship hub. Many people pursue entrepreneurship to expand their network and retain profits. A common problem for businesses is keeping up to date with the current health of their company. Many small businesses in particular, donâ€™t have systems put in place to measure their overall success. Quantify depicts the overall health of the business with key metrics such as: costs of goods sold, operating expenses, current assets, long-term liabilities, total debt, cash flow, etc. We decided to create a web app that gives businesses a grade of how well their business is performing. The user can submit their data and the site provides metric analysis based on the input data. This analysis page gives them a breakdown of their grade to understand where and how to grow. We built the web application utilizing back end and frontend development. We built the web application utilizing Python, PHP, and HTML/CSS.

							<p><strong>Park-Alert</strong> - <em>Capstone Project</em><br /><small>December 2016</small><br /> This project was part of a high school engineering course and the idea was born out of my frustration with the school's parking situation. Using 3D printing, a Raspberry Pi, and Python programming, I designed and created a prototype parking sensor that is capable of recognizing the status of spots in a parking lot and relays that information to a user via text or email. </p>
