						<h3> Experience </h3>
				        <p> Supplemental Instruction Leader - <em>Georgia State University</em><br /><small>AUGUST 2019 - PRESENT</small><br />I currently serve as a mentor, leader, and resource for students currently enrolled in Calculus I. My responsibilities include organizing, planning, and facilitating three weekly supplemental study sessions designed for students to work together and improve their study skills, learning skills, and communication skills.</p>

				        <p> Information Technology Intern - <em>The Walker School</em><br /><small>MAY 2019 - AUGUST 2019, MAY 2018 - AUGUST 2018</small><br />As an intern for my alma mater, I provided assistance to Director of Technology and provisioned new employees and students with organization emails, keycards, building access, and administration accounts. I also assisted with setting up internet and technology within recently opened Science and Technology building and the annual rollover of new technology.</p>

						<h3> Education </h3>
				        <p> Georgia State University - <em>Sophomore (GPA: 4.06)</em><br /><small>JUNE 2018 - MAY 2022</small><br />I am currently in pursuit of a B.S in Computer Science. <br /> Relevant Courses: Computer Science Principles I, II, and Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science</p>

				        <p> E-Learning - <em>Udemy, Codecademy</em><br />HTML/CSS/JS, Web Development, Python, React, SQL</p>

						<h3> Projects </h3>
				        <p> Quantify - <em>PantherHack</em><br /><small>MARCH 2019, FIRST PLACE</small><br />This project was the brainchild of five strangers who wanted to make a product that benefits the greater Atlanta community, specifically small businesses. Quantify depicts the overall health of any given business with key metrics such as: costs of goods sold, operating expenses, current assets, long-term liabilities, total debt, cash flow, etc. My primary contribution was the creation of the webpage using CSS/HTML/Javascript.</p>

				        <p> Park-Alert - <em>Capstone Project</em><br /><small>DECEMBER 2016</small><br />This project was part of a high school engineering course. Using 3D printing, a Raspberry Pi, and Python programming, I designed and created a prototype parking sensor that is capable of recognizing the status of spots in a parking lot and relays that information to a user via text or email.</p>
