									<p><strong>About me</strong> | My name is Elena (pronounced eh-lAy-nah), I am studying Computer Science in Atlanta, Georgia, and I want to be a software developer. My experience so far is limited so I'm looking for opportunities where I can find my passion within the realm of technology and earn real world experience.</p>
									<p><strong>Georgia State University</strong> <em> Class of 2022</em> | I am in pursuit of a B.S in Computer Science.</p>
									<p><strong>Relevant courses include:</strong></p>
									<ul>
										<li><em>Principles of Computer Science (I/II)</em> - Introductory two part sequence in Java, focused on introducing algorithmic foundations, basic data structures, hardware concepts, virtual machine concepts, software systems, and applications.</li>
										<li><em>Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science</em> - Discrete mathematics for computer science covering propositional and predicate logic, induction, algorithms, functions, and graphs.</li>
										<li><em>Calculus of One Variable (I/II)</em> - Two part sequence covering differential and integral calculus techniques and their applications.</li>
										<li><em>Principles of Physics (I/II)</em> - Calculus based two part survey covering the primary fields of physics, including mechanics, waves, simple harmonic motion, electromagnetism, and optics. </li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>Next semester,</strong> I am registered to take <em>Data Structures</em> and <em>Python Programming for Data Science</em>.</p>

									<p><strong>Supplemental Instruction Leader</strong> | At Georgia State University, I work as an SI Leader. My role is to be a resource, mentor, and leader for students enrolled in Calculus I. Every week I plan and facilitate three study sessions for students who need a little help in Calculus I. </p>
									<p><strong>Affiliated Groups</strong> | Girls++, PantherHackers - Webmaster, Latin American Student Association, Association for Computing Machinery</p>

										<h3>PantherHackers</h3>
										<h6>Website - 2019</h6>
										<p>In my spare time I serve as webmaster for PantherHackers, one of the computer science organizations at Georgia State. I am in the process of creating a new website for the organization and hope to create something fresh and informative for our members.</p>

										<h3>Unnamed Project</h3>
										<h6>Personal Project - 2019</h6>
										<p>In an attempt to make life at home a little easier, I am working on making a bot that checks the status of our garage doors and sends an alert to the household if it has been left open at night. I plan to use a Raspberry Pi, a magnetic switch, and Python. </p>
									</header>
									<div class="content s">
										<p>My dad has complained to me about how our new garage door opener is advanced enough to have an app that lets us see the status of our garage doors and even open or close them remotely but does nothing to help us keep from leaving it open overnight. I have only just begun but I will continue to post my progress here. </p>

										<h3>Quantify</h3>
										<h6>PantherHack 2019</h6>
										<h6>Winner</h6>

										<p>This project was the brainchild of five strangers who wanted to make a product that benefits the greater Atlanta community, specifically small businesses. Quantify depicts the overall health of any given business with key metrics such as: costs of goods sold, operating expenses, current assets, long-term liabilities, total debt, cash flow, etc. My primary contribution was the creation of the webpage using CSS/HTML/Javascript.</p>

										<h3>Park-Alert</h3>
										<p>This project was part of a high school engineering course. Using 3D printing, a Raspberry Pi, and Python programming, I designed and created a prototype parking sensor that is capable of recognizing the status of spots in a parking lot and relays that information to a user via text or email.</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content s">
										<p>In effort to eliminate a personal grievance with the parking situation at Walker, I took advantage of the capstone project for my Intro to Engineering course in my junior jear of high school. It was a super fun project and I learned a lot. This project was my first experience with Python and first time working with a Raspberry Pi.
